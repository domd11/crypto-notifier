# crypto-notifier

Using the Gecko Crypto API, I grab data every hour about the selected crypto currency and email/text myself the price. Depending on the current price and target prices, the text/email will tell me to sell or keep the crypto currency. I used a tutorial about getting api data on youtube and another tutorial on sending messages with twilio and emails with google. There is another version but I plan to keep that one private, but you can do a lot with this project.
